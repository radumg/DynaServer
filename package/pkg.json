  "description": "A Dynamo Extension that allows communication and remote control of Dynamo as a REST API.\r\n  Using a browser, you can interogate Dynamo running on your machine on what it's doing, or remotely control Dynamo and tell it to do stuff.\r\n  It can do a bunch of stuff out of the box, like open graphs, execute them, add nodes to canvas, report what packages are installed, etc.\r\n  The extension also works on remote machines, but Windows Firewall exceptions have to be manually added at the moment. \r\n  The extension installs a new DynaServer menu item, which allows you to start & stop the server.\r\n  Once started, you can access the server at http://localhost:1234.\r\n  The server start page contains a list of all current endpoints with interactive testing buttons too.",
